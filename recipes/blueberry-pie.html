    <h6>This is my mom's blueberry pie recipe. It is a tradition among our family. It's a 
    candied blueberry filling atop a custard base. The crust is similar to a traditional key 
    lime pie crust, but it is made from vanilla wafers instead. I hope you enjoy!</h6>
    <h3>Ingredients:(These Serve as Placeholders)</h3>
    <ul>2 cups fresh blueberries (or frozen, thawed)</ul>
    <ul>¾ cup granulated sugar</ul>
    <ul>2 tbsp cornstarch</ul>
    <ul>1 tbsp lemon juice</ul>
    <ul>¼ tsp ground cinnamon (optional)</ul>
    <ul>¼ tsp salt</ul>
    <ul>1 tbsp butter, cut into small pieces</ul>
    <ul>1 package of store-bought pie crusts</ul>
    <ul>1 egg (for egg wash)</ul>
    <ul>1 tbsp milk (for egg wash)</ul>
    <h3>Steps: (These Serve as Placeholders)</h3>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 400°F (200°C).</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat the filling</strong> in a large bowl, combine blueberries, sugar, 
    cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt. Gently toss to mix, ensuring the blueberries 
    are evenly coated.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll out the crust</strong> and place one of the pie crusts into a 9-inch pie dish. 
    Press it firmly into the dish, trimming any excess around the edges.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the filling</strong> by pouring the blueberry mixture into the prepared pie crust. 
    Dot the filling with small pieces of butter.</li>
    <li><strong>Top the pie</strong> so roll out the second pie crust and place it over the blueberries. 
    You can either place it as a whole sheet or cut it into strips for a lattice top. Seal the 
    edges by crimping them together.</li>
